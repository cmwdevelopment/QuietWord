# QuietWord Keyboard Shortcuts

Quick reference for keyboard navigation in QuietWord.

## Reader Page (`/reader/john` or `/reader/psalm`)

| Key | Action | Notes |
|-----|--------|-------|
| `→` | Next chunk | Navigate to next reading chunk |
| `←` | Previous chunk | Navigate to previous reading chunk |
| `ESC` | Exit to home | Return to home dashboard |

### Smart Behavior

The shortcuts are **intelligently disabled** when:
- You're at a checkpoint (typing in note field)
- An input or textarea is focused
- You've reached the first/last chunk (prevents navigation past boundaries)

### Visual Hint

Look for the hint in the Reader header:
```
ESC to exit • ← → to navigate
```
